The **icarogw pipeline** is a flexible and extensible framework for automating **gravitational-wave population and cosmological inference** with [icarogw](https://github.com/simone-mastrogiovanni/icarogw).

It provides an end-to-end workflow to:  
- Initialize the **population model** and hierarchical likelihood  
- Run Bayesian samplers for population and cosmology  
- Postprocess results with built-in diagnostics and visualizations  

In addition, dedicated submodules support:  
- **Synthetic catalog generation** and sensitivity estimates for selection effects  
- **Parameter estimation** on gravitational-wave events with [bilby](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/)
